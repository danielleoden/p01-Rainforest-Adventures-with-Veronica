      As you and Veronica reach the herd of antelope you start to shield yourself behind them.
      You realize that this was a good idea because the antelope are a very kind breed of animal.
      You both start to look around and Veronica says she thinks a path behind both of you looks familiar.
      At the same time you think climbing up a steep mountain side would be a better idea.
      You both argue for a few minutes and finally Veronica just tells you to pick which way to go.
