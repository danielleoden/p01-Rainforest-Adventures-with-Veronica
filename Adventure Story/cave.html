      Both you and Veronica squeeze into a small opening of a cave that is too tight for the komodo dragon to get through.
        Soon you and Veronica are safe again but the problem is that the cave is pitch black.
        Luckily, Veronica brought a lighter.
        She lights her lighter, and as your pupils a just, you see hundreds of bats hanging from the ceiling.
        In panic, you scream and the bats start flying everywhere.
        You and Veronica start to run, and then a bat swoops down and bites a chunk of your ear off.
        You know you have no time to worry about the pain and it is time to make a decision of where you and Veronica will escape to.
