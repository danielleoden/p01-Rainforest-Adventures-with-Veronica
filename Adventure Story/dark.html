    As you both start walking down the dark path, you can see that the trees let hardly any sunlight in.
    A small ray of sunlight is streaming down in front of you and Veronica yells at you to watch out.
    You immediately realize that she warned you too late.
    Veronica saw a giant spider web because of the ray of light, but you were unfortunate and did not see it.
    Now you are stuck in a giant spider web.
    Veronica grabs you good hand tries to pull you out, and then all of a sudden, she lets go and runs back the other direction.
    You start to feel the web shake and look to the side and see an enormous spider crawling right at you.
    Before you can scream, the spider sinks its fangs into you, injecting you with its debilitating poison, so it can eat you.
