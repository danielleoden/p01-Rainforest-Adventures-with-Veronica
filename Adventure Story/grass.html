      As you both finally reach the grass field, Veronica takes one of her long sock off and ties it tightly to your wrist to stop the blood flow.
      When both of you think that absolutely nothing else could get worse, you feel a prick at your ankle.
      You look down and see that a scorpion just stung you.
      You realize that the nice grass field is actually infested with scorpions.
      As you got bit Veronica sees a path that she thinks looks familiar.
      You however, think that you should go down the dark path that is shaded with trees because it is closer.
      Veronica tells you to hurry up and decide which way to go.
