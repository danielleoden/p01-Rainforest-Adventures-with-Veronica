      You and Veronica are going on a journey through the rainforest.
      Little do both of you know, that the rainforest is a very dangerous place.
      You both begin walking and admiring the scenery.
      You two also become aware of the many sounds that are in the rainforest.
      The rainforest is filled with hundreds of different animal sounds.  Then all of a sudden, the forest is quite.
      Veronica turns around to see what is going on and realizes why the forest went quiet.
      As quickly as she can, she grabs you and tells you to run because there is a komodo dragon not far behind you.
      You both start sprinting through the forest as fast as you can.
      Veronica sees two way to get away from the komodo dragon and asks you frantically which way you want to go.
