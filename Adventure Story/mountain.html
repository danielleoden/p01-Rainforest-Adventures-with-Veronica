      After a long and strenuous climb up the mountain side, you and Veronica finally make it to the top.
      You both lay down at the top to rest and catch your breath.
      Then Veronica starts screaming at you to get up.
      You look to see what is going on, and flying not far away from you is a helicopter.
      You both start jumping up and down and waving your arms around.
      The person flying the helicopter sees you and lands in front of you.
      Both of you run to the helicopter and get in.
      Even though the rainforest was quite the adventure, you are both glad that you are now safe and on your way home.
