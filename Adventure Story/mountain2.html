      After a long and strenuous climb up the mountain side, you and Veronica finally make it to the top.
      You both lay down at the top to rest and catch your breath.
      Then Veronica starts screaming at you to get up.
      You look to see what is going on, and flying not far away from you is a helicopter.
      You both start jumping up and down and waving your arms around.
      The person flying the helicopter does not see you and starts flying it in the other direction.
      At that moment you realize that both you and Veronica are going to be lost in the rainforest forever.
