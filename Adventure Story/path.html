      Finally you and Veronica escape the bats by running down the path in the cave.
        You both stop for a second so Veronica can examine your ear.
        Your ear is bleeding pretty badly so Veronica takes her thick hiking sweat band
        and puts it around your head and over your ear to try and stop the bleeding and absorb some of the blood.
         Once she finishes, you both continue walking.
         As you are walking you notice many interesting looking plants.
         You reach out to touch one and it bits off your hand.
         As you screech out in pain the rest of the plants start trying to snap at you and Veronica.
         You both realize that the plants are man eating Venus Fly Traps and start running away.
        Veronica yells at you that it is time to pick which way to go again.
