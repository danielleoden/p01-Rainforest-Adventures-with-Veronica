    Both you and Veronica start climbing up the tree as quickly as possible.
      As you both are climbing you feel the tree shaking from underneath you.
      The komodo dragon is trying to follow you up it.
      Thankfully it is too heavy for its claws to pull it up the tree, so it eventually walks away.
      You both decide to climb higher into the tree to look at the view.
      As you and Veronica are looking at the view, the tree starts to shake again, as well as everything around you.
      Before either of you figure out what is going on an elephant runs into the tree knocking it over.
